## Features
- **Realistic Load Balancing**
  - Tasks are distributed across multiple servers based on their **current utilization**, minimizing queue times and improving throughput.
- **Dynamic Task Generation**
  - The task generator produces tasks based on **exponential distribution** to simulate real-world workload at varying intervals with adjustable service times, simulating fluctuating workloads.
- **Server Queuing and Processing**
  - Each server maintains a queue, processes tasks sequentially, and tracks metrics such as average wait time, queue length, and utilization.
- **Global Time Management**
  - A global clock manages the progression of simulation time, controlling task scheduling and execution.
- **Performance Analysis**
  - The analyzer computes **key performance indicators (KPIs)** such as average delay, wait times, and queue lengths, summarizing each server efficiency post-simulation.
- **Configurable Parameters**: 
  - Users can adjust the simulation speed, average service time, number of servers, task generation frequency, and simulation duration. Additionally, each serverâ€™s processing power, queue size, and utilization tracking can be configured to **optimize resource usage and load balancing**.

## Architecture
#### The project is structured into modular components, ensuring **maintainability** and **scalability**.

### Key Components:

- #### GlobalClock
  - Manages and synchronizes the simulation time.

- #### LoadBalancer
  - Routes tasks to the least utilized server.

- #### ServerQueue
  - Represents individual servers that process incoming tasks.

- #### TaskGenerator
  - Creates tasks at specified intervals and forwards them to the load balancer.

- #### Analyzer
  - Parses server logs and computes performance metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++11 or higher
- g++
- Standard C++ libraries

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MedhatHassan/Load-Balancer.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Load-Balancer/src
```
3. Build the project using g++:
```bash
g++ mian.cpp -o simulation
```

### Running the Simulation
After building the project, execute the simulation with:
```bash
./simulation
```
The simulation will run for a predefined duration, generating log files and results file.

### Configuration
#### Modify the main.cpp file to adjust the following parameters:

- Simulation Speed: Adjust the `speed` variable.
- Average Service Time: Set the `averageServiceTime`.
- Number of Servers: Update the `NumberofServers` variable.
- Task generate frequency: Update the value `TG.start(0.3)`
- Simulation Duration: Update the value `simulationDuration` in seconds.
---
### Log Files
The simulation generates several log files:

- **Task Log** (`task_log.txt`): Logs task creation time and service time.
- **Server Logs** (`serverX_log.txt`): Logs server activity, including task queue size and utilization.
- **Analyzer Results** (`analyzer_results.txt`): Summarizes the performance metrics of each server post-simulation.
---
### Analyzer Output
The analyzer calculates:
- **Average Delay Time**: The time difference between task generation and completion.
- **Average Waiting Time**: The time tasks spend waiting in the queue.
- **Average Queue Length**: The average number of tasks in the server queue.

Example Output:
```bash
Server ID: 0, Average Delay time: 12.45, Average Waiting time: 48.41, Average Queue length: 4
Server ID: 1, Average Delay time: 15.76, Average Waiting time: 87.74, Average Queue length: 8
Server ID: 2, Average Delay time: 19.32, Average Waiting time: 132.29, Average Queue length: 12
```
